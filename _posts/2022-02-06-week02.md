### The benefits of having a code of conduct document 
A Code of Conduct document is to essentially align everyone on the same values and expectations when contributing to a project. The benefit of this is to provide a welcoming environment for beginners or a friendly reminder to pre-existing contributers on standard practices and behaviors to uphold within a community. I do think that other projects would benefit from having a Code of Conduct document as it serves as a good starting point for beginners who are new to a community as well as a guide for project maintainers to come back to if there might be any conflicts of interest between members.
